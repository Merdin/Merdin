# Welcome to my profile! üëãüèª 

My name is Merdin, a passionate Software Engineer.

I've been interested in tech since I was born. Started learning to code since 12 years old. I have a passion for building well-engineered and beautiful applications.

Naturally I am very mature, responsible and very structured. This has allowed me to work in positions from an early age with no experience that not many peers could abide by.

As someone who enjoys learning, also unrelated to his work, it is necessary for me to work remotely. I want this to not waste my time on, for example, unnecessary chatter, travel time and other matters. In addition, I can concentrate much better in a room where no one can distract me. If this allows me to do more in the same amount of time, why would anyone stop me?

üìö To improve myself as a professional Software Engineer I‚Äôm following the [Lead Essentials program](https://iosacademy.essentialdeveloper.com/p/ios-lead-essentials/).

## Personal projects
### Tomato countdown app
[Tomato - Countdown app](https://tomato.merdin.dev) is a macOS menu bar app which I develop. This app shows a count down timer in your menu bar and pushes a notification when it finishes. The developers from Essential Developer showed me the **Pomodoro Technique** in one of their videos and that inspired me to make this app.

### Awqati
[Awqati.nl](https://awqati.nl) is a web and mobile app which I develop. The goal of the app is to provide the correct prayer times to the users per city. You can find similar apps, but most of these show incorrect prayer times due to automated calculations. For this app we calculate the prayer times manually and store them inside the app.
The app is built with Flutter and Firebase is used for storage, hosting and authorization.
