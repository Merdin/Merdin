# Merdin Kahrimanovic
Software Engineer<br>

I've been interested in tech since I was born. Started learning to code since 12 years old. I have a passion for building well-engineered and beautiful applications.

Naturally I am very mature, responsible and very structured. This has allowed me to work in positions from an early age with no experience that not many peers could abide by.

As someone who enjoys learning, also unrelated to his work, it is necessary for me to work remotely. I want this to not waste my time on, for example, unnecessary chatter, travel time and other matters. In addition, I can concentrate much better in a room where no one can distract me. If this allows me to do more in the same amount of time, why would anyone stop me?

## Experience

#### Software Engineer @ [WeAreReasonablePeople](https://wearereasonablepeople.com/) <br>
##### September 2022 - December 2022<br>
At WARP I spend most of the time designing and developing the server-side application written with TypeScript/NestJS for a start-up project. I connected the server-side application with AWS Cognito.

Besides that I worked on the dashboard project build with NextJS, React, Tailwind. 

I worked completely remote, unless there was a need for me to be at the office.

##### September 2021 - May 2022<br>
While working for Move4Mobile I developed native apps with Swift and I did this by maintaining a non-production app for 6 months and shift between 2 production apps to deliver new features, fix bugs and add ideas for the apps by myself. 

I worked completely remote, and would be at the office for some meetings.
