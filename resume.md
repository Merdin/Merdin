# Merdin Kahrimanovic
Software Engineer<br>

I've been interested in tech since I was born. Started learning to code since 12 years old. I have a passion for building well-engineered and beautiful applications.

Naturally I am very mature, responsible and very structured. This has allowed me to work in positions from an early age with no experience that not many peers could abide by.

As someone who enjoys learning, also unrelated to his work, it is necessary for me to work remotely. I want this to not waste my time on, for example, unnecessary chatter, travel time and other matters. In addition, I can concentrate much better in a room where no one can distract me. If this allows me to do more in the same amount of time, why would anyone stop me?

## Experience
